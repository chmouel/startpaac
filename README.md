# ðŸš€ StartPAAC - All in one setup for Pipelines as Code on Kind

`startpaac` is a script to set up and configure Pipelines as Code (PAC) on a
Kubernetes cluster using Kind. It supports installing various components such
as Nginx, Tekton, and Forgejo, and configuring PAC with secrets.

Components that get installed are:

- Kind cluster
- Nginx ingress gateway
- Forgejo for local dev
- Docker registry to push images to.
- Tekton latest release
- Tekton dashboard latest
- PAC using ko from your local revision

## Prerequisites

- [Docker]() - We only tested with docker currently, it may works with podman but i haven't tested it yet
- [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) - Kubernetes in Docker
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/) - Kubernetes package manager
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) - Kubernetes command-line tool
- [ko](https://github.com/google/ko) - Build and deploy Go applications on Kubernetes
- [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) (optional, for managing secrets) - Password manager
- GNU Tools (ie for osx/bsd use the one from homebrew like
[coreutils](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/coreutils) and
[sed](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gnu-sed#default) and configure them in
your path).

## Getting Started

execute or adapt the following, adjust the path of the PAC folder where you
have checked out pipelines-as-code:

```shell
mkdir -p $HOME/.config/startpaac
cat <<EOF > $HOME/.config/startpaac/config
TARGET_HOST=local
PAC_DIR=~/go/src/github.com/openshift-pipelines/pipelines-as-code
PAC_SECRET_FOLDER=~/secrets
EOF
```

Create your GitHub application and grab all the info needed and put them in
each secret file for example:

```shell
mkdir -p ~/secrets
for i in github-application-id github-private-key smee webhook.secret;do
  echo "Editing $i file"
  ${EDITOR:-vi} ~/secrets/$i
fi
```

execute to deploy the kind cluster, the registry, nginx, paac, gitea etc..:

```shell
./startpaac -a
```

if you need to deploy a change  you made to your code to the local registry you
do:

```bash
startpaac -p 
```

this has redeployed everything, if you only want to redeploy the controller you can do:

```bash
startpaac -c controller # same goes for watcher or webhook
```

if you want to spin down the kind cluster you can do:

```bash
startpaac --stop-kind
```

## Configuration

Create a configuration file at `$HOME/.config/startpaac/config` with the following content:
(this will be auto created by paac if you don't have one)

## Full Configuration

```bash
# PAC_DIR is the path to the pipelines-as-code directory, it will try to detect
# it otherwise
# PAC_DIR=~/path/to/pipelines-as-code
#
# PAC_PASS_SECRET_FOLDER is the path to a folder in https://passwordstore.org/
# where you have your pac secrets. The folder contains those keys:
# github/apps/my-app
# â”œâ”€â”€ github-application-id
# â”œâ”€â”€ github-private-key
# â”œâ”€â”€ smee
# â””â”€â”€ webhook.secret
# github-application-id and github-private-key are the github application id and private key when you create your github app
# smee is the smee.io or https://hook.pipelinesascode.com generated webhook URL as set in your github apps.
# webhook.secret is the shared secret as set in your github apps.
# PAC_PASS_SECRET_FOLDER=github/apps/my-app
#
# PAC_SECRET_FOLDER is an alternative to PASS_SECRET_FOLDER where you have your
# pac secrets in plain text. The folder has the same structure as the
# PASS_SECRET_FOLDER the only difference is that the files are in plain text.
#
# PAC_SECRET_FOLDER=~/path/to/secrets
#
# TARGET_HOST is your vm where kind will be running, you need to have kind working there
# set as local and unset all other variable to have it running on your local VM
# TARGET_HOST=my.vm.lan
#
# KO_EXTRA_FLAGS are the extra flags to pass to ko
#
# KO_EXTRA_FLAGS=() # extra ko flags for example --platform linux/arm64 --insecure-registry
## Hosts (not needed if TARGET_HOST is set to local)
# setup a wildcard dns *.lan.mydomain.com to go to your TARGET_HOST vm
# tips: if you don't want to install a dns server you can simply use
# https://nextdns.io to let you create wildcard dns for your local network.
#
# DOMAIN_NAME=lan.mydomain.com
# PAAC=paac.${DOMAIN_NAME}
# REGISTRY=registry.${DOMAIN_NAME}
# FORGE_HOST=gitea.${DOMAIN_NAME}
# DASHBOARD=dashboard.${DASHBOARD}
#
# Example:
# TARGET_HOST=civuole.lan
# KO_EXTRA_FLAGS=(--insecure-registry --platform linux/arm64)
# DOMAIN_NAME=vm.lan
# PAAC=paac.${DOMAIN_NAME}
# REGISTRY=registry.${DOMAIN_NAME}
# FORGE_HOST=gitea.${DOMAIN_NAME}
# TARGET_BIND_IP=192.168.1.5
# DASHBOARD=dashboard.${DOMAIN_NAME}
# PAC_DIR=$GOPATH/src/github.com/openshift-pipelines/pac/main
```

You can have an alternative config file with the `STARTPAAC_CONFIG_FILE`
environment variable.

## Secrets Management

### Using `pass`

If you prefer to manage your secrets using `pass`, set the
`PAC_PASS_SECRET_FOLDER` variable in your configuration file to the path of
your secrets folder in `pass`. The folder should contain the following files:

- `github-application-id`
- `github-private-key`
- `smee`
- `webhook.secret`

Example structure:

```console
github/apps/my-app
â”œâ”€â”€ github-application-id
â”œâ”€â”€ github-private-key
â”œâ”€â”€ smee
â””â”€â”€ webhook.secret
```

### Using Plain Text

Alternatively, you can store your secrets in plain text files. Set the
`PAC_SECRET_FOLDER` variable in your configuration file to the path of your
secrets folder. The folder should have the same structure as the `pass` folder,
but the files should be in plain text.

Example structure:

```console
~/path/to/secrets
â”œâ”€â”€ github-application-id
â”œâ”€â”€ github-private-key
â”œâ”€â”€ smee
â””â”€â”€ webhook.secret
```

## Usage

Run the script with the desired options:

```sh
./startpaac [options]
```

By default, the script will install everything asking you to confirm before. If
you don't want confirmation just use the `-a` option.

### Options

- `-a|--all`                Install everything
- `-A|--all-but-kind`       Install everything but kind
- `-k|--kind`               (Re)Install Kind
- `-g|--install-forge`      Install Forgejo
- `-c|--component`          Deploy a component (controller, watcher, webhook)
- `-p|--install-paac`       Deploy and configure PAC
- `-h|--help`               Show help message
- `-s|--sync-kubeconfig`    Sync kubeconfig from the remote host
- `-G|--start-user-gosmee`  Start gosmee locally for user $USER
- `-S|--github-second-ctrl` Deploy second controller for GitHub
- `--install-nginx`         Install Nginx
- `--install-dashboard`     Install Tekton dashboard
- `--install-tekton`        Install Tekton
- `--install-custom-crds`   Install custom CRDs
- `--second-secret=SECRET`  Pass name for the second controller secret
- `--stop-kind`             Stop Kind

## Examples

### Install Everything

```sh
./startpaac --all
```

### Install PAC and Configure

```sh
./startpaac --install-paac
```

### Install Nginx

```sh
./startpaac --install-nginx
```

### Install Tekton

```sh
./startpaac --install-tekton
```

### Install Custom CRDs

```sh
./startpaac --install-custom-crds
```

### Deploy a Specific Component

```sh
./startpaac --component controller
```

### Sync Kubeconfig from Remote Host

```sh
./startpaac --sync-kubeconfig
```

### Start User Gosmee

```sh
./startpaac --start-user-gosmee
```

it will try to start gosmee for the user if you have a systemd user one, or
give you the command line to start it.

### Deploy Second Controller for GitHub

```sh
./startpaac --github-second-ctrl
```

you need the `PAC_PASS_SECOND_FOLDER` which is the same
`PAC_PASS_SECRET_FOLDER` but for a second controller to use.

## ZSH Completion

There is a [ZSH completion script](./misc/_startpaac) that can get installed in your

path for completion.
